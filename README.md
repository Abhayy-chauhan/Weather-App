Welcome to the Weather App! This application provides real-time weather information based on your current location or any city you specify. By allowing location access, the app automatically fetches and displays 
weather details such as cloud cover, humidity, and wind speed for your current location, ensuring you always have up-to-date and location-specific weather information at your fingertips. Additionally, the app 
features a city-based weather search, enabling you to enter the name of any city and receive detailed weather data for that location. This is particularly useful for travelers or those who need to check weather
conditions for friends and family in different cities.
